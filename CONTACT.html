    <p class="star_wars">Why don't you try turning this </br>
        text box into a star wars type text</br>
        scroll, where it fades in the </br>
        distance, using purely css? Don't think its possible? </br>
        I have done it before and its easier than you think!</br>
        Obviously if you feel the need to, create more text </br>
        here to elongate the paragraph. This will affect the time</br>
        it takes for the text to travel up the page and into the </br>
        fade our area.
