    <p>In alignment with our vision, we at Umeed Academy have adopted a holistic approach for our children. .</br> 
        We aim at providing education of the privileged to the underprivileged. To achieve that goal, we follow the CBSE 
        curriculum with special emphasis on out-come based learning, discussion, debates and interdisciplinary learning. 
        We have developed a well-integrated system of curriculum, instruction and assessment where learning outcomes, 
        teaching objectives and goals are clearly defined for teachers. We do not want our children to become knowledge banks 
        in the future , but rather good capable human beings with the capacity to transform self and others into responsible,
         dignified individuals with a strong civic sense and a sound character.

    <h2 class="third_header">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>The academic year is organised into six instructional cycles, with each cycle’s conclusion being either an assessment 
        test or a term exam that serves to measure the students’ progress in accordance with specific evaluation standards.
       </br>   We also believe in the holistic development of our students, that is done through Continuous Class Evaluation(CCE).
       Numerous activities and contests are held during the session in the premise these enjoyable activities complement 
       excellent instruction.
